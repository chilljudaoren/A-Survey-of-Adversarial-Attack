This is the repository of <b><q>Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language Multimodal Systems: A Survey</q></b>, a systematic survey of VLM adversarial attack studies in various adversarial attacks including Adversarial Jailbreak Attack, Adversarail Prompt Attack, Knowledge-based Adversarial Attack, etc. For details, please refer to:

<h2> 🙌 Abstract </h2>

With the boom of artificial intelligence, multimodal deep learning, especially vision-language multimodal systems (VLMS), has advanced remarkably and found wide applications. However, their adversarial security issues hamper further development. This paper comprehensively reviews adversarial attacks on VLMS. It first details multimodal deep-learning key technologies and the features of relevant models. Then, it deeply analyzes the adversarial vulnerabilities of VLMS. Next, it systematically reviews various adversarial attack methods in multimodal systems, covering task-specific attacks and attacks on different models, with a detailed analysis of their principles, implementations, and effects. Finally, it looks ahead to the future of multimodal adversarial attacks, suggesting research directions like improving attack universality and black-box attack capabilities. This review offers technical references, promotes research on multimodal adversarial attacks, and helps enhance VLMS security for reliable real-world applications.
